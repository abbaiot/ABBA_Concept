# An implementation of ABBA
This file contains the description of the code as implemented in node-red and is a specific instance of the algorithm presented in section VI of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03942.pdf).

# Pre-requisite
To run the code proposed here, the user will need to install
* [Node-red](https://nodered.org/).
* Install the Node-red-dashboard through the node-red menu.
* The Mersenne Twister Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG). Following instructions given here in http://npmjs.com/package/mersenne-twister.
To use the Mersenne Twister module, the user will navigate to the .node-red folder and open the setting.re file to add "MersenneTwister:require(mersenne-twister')," in "functionGlobalcontext" (Tested on MacOS and Raspbian).
