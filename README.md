# What is ABBA?
ABBA stands for Artificial Behaviour Based Authentication. Strictly speaking it is an intrusion detection system that enables a central controler to monitor data from a network of devices for signs of intrusion by an attacker.
This technique is based off of a weak form of authentication of the data transmitted by networked devices using pulses distributed pseudo-randomly over time. The pulse sequence is akin to a behaviour for any specific device, hence the name of the technique.

# Origins
ABBA was developed by [Dr. Raoul F. Guiazon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raoulguiazon/) with the support of the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Office of the Chief Science Adviser for National Security under the UK Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme.
The aim of this project is to improve the security of sensor networks - which are often at the foundation of many critical infrastructure - by increasing the probability of detection of malicious activities within the network.

# Foundation

The algorithm implemented here is based on the article ["ABBA: A quasi-deterministic Intrusion Detection System for the Internet of Things"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.03942.pdf). That article defines the conceptual structure and framework of the technique ABBA and provides mathematical proofs with respect to the probability of detection of an intruder given the types of primitives used in any practical implementation. Any such implementation like the one present in this repository will come with different security garantees due to the primitives and parameters chosen.

# Implementation

The code presented here is developed using [Node-red](https://nodered.org/) a low-code programming tool for event-driven applications and based on Node.js. This was chosen for the ease of use and the flexibility it allows in quickly building and testing prototypes with easily available sensors. 

# Warning

The code available is at a very early stage of development an should only be used for testing and research purposes.

# Future development

Please feel free to contribute to this project, the list of issues to address will be available shortly along with the long term vision for this project.
